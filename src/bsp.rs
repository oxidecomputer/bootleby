//! Types and hooks for implementing Board Support Packages (BSPs) for bootleby.
//!
//! The bootleby BSP requirements are very simple, since for the most part, bootleby
//! doesn't care about the board. The exact properties that need to be described
//! are in the `Bsp` trait below.
//!
//! To implement a BSP:
//!
//! 1. Create a module within `bootleby::bsp` named after your board.
//! 2. Define a type in the module called `Board`. This type will never be
//!    instantiated, so it can be arbitrary; an empty enum is easy.
//! 3. Implement `bootleby::bsp::Bsp` for your `Board` type.
//! 4. Add a `target-board-*` feature to `Cargo.toml`.
//! 5. Add a branch to the `cfg_if` in `src/bin/bootleby.rs` to detect your board
//!    and select the right `Board` type.

// Note that these modules are not conditionally included. We always compile
// every BSP because we can currently get away with that -- none are mutually
// exclusive or need different build settings -- and this helps to ensure that
// everything actually builds.
//
// We may have to stop doing this eventually but it's nice for now.
